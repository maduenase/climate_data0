# Panel datasets with GHGE indicators and Cohesion Funds expending NUTS2

Some useful data connected to climate change

In analysing the European Union's efforts towards a Low-Carbon Economy, we turned to the Cohesion Open Data Platform, explicitly using the investment data for the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 funding periods. The Low-Carbon Economy investments offered a consistent thematic framework for analysis despite minor thematic changes between the two periods. To ensure comparability and coherence, we aligned the thematic objectives across both periods, creating a correspondence table that standardised the categories of thematic objectives.

Our primary data source was the Cohesion categorisation raw data derived from closure reports, which provide a granular view of the thematic content financed during these periods. Specifically, the datasets for both periods encompass cumulative categorisation data on projects as reported in the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Cohesion Fund (CF), and European Social Fund (ESF) programme final implementation reports as presented in the closure documentation. This data contains the volume of EU support allocated to projects alongside a combination of categorisation dimension codes, including priority themes, a form of finance, the territorial context, location (using NUTS-2 2021 codes), and the economic dimension.
The EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research), managed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, provides a global inventory of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants. Here, we specifically use the data at the NUTS-2 level to analyse emissions in European regions.

Some economic variables were obtained from the ARDECO (the Annual Regional Database of the European Commission's Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy), which contains annual data at the regional level and is maintained and updated by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. An advantage of ARDECO is that it offers a set of variables with a long time series.

We include the OECD Environmental Policy Stringency (EPS) Index. This index provides a standardised composite measure incorporating both market and non-market-based policies, covering 27 OECD over the period from 1990 to 2020.
